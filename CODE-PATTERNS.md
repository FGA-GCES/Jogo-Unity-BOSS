# Code Patterns
For a coherent development of the codes of the game, and for a better readability and comprehention of all members of the group, this artifact was developed to solve all this issues, building Code Patterns as a solution.

For every outside contribution in this project, it is also necessary to follow these guidelines.

The patterns presented below are heavily inspired by [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), a much popular style of code, marked by the junction of words, making their division by upper case letters.

## Classes and Methods
The name of the classes will follow the classic CamelCase, where the first letter of the every word, including the first of them all, will be upper case. The methods on the other hand will have the first letter of them all lower case, whilst the next words will have the first letter upper case.

## Attributes
Attributes will follow the same guidelines as the methods.

## Scenes and GameObjects
Both will follow the same guidelines as the classes, having the first letter of them all upper case.
